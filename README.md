## A tool that creates the skeleton structure of projects for us

Most projects are structured quite similiarly, so this script when given a project name creates a directory named after the project. 

It also creates a README that containts the project name and author name, a TODO file and a main python file with boilerplate code inside it.

## Installation
clone the repository.
```
 https://github.com/daspartho/auto-project-builder.git
```

## Usage
Run the script from a terminal using
```
python main.py
```

## Contributing
If you want to contribute code, just write a quick pull request and the developers will take a look at it.
If you want to suggest an idea, just write an issue and the developers will check it out!
